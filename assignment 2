Access modifiers are used to specify the scope of accessibility of a member of a class or type of the class itself. 

2. Readonly variable cannot be modified at run-time. It can only be initialized or changed in the constructor. Constant variables cannot be modified after declaration. Static members can be accessed using ClassName.

3.A constructor is a special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object of that type. 

4. With partial classes, we can physically separate a class into multiple files.

5. Tuples are great for passing multiple variables between methods

6. we use the record keyword to define a reference type that provides built-in functionality for encapsulating data.

7. Fields are ordinary member variables or member instances of a class. Properties are an abstraction to get and set their values.
